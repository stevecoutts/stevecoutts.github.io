		<p>My research focuses on the intersection of smart cities, open data, and public participation through an equity lens.</p>
	<p>I'm concerned with spatial patterns of socioeconomic disparity becoming entrenched within our cities, with marginalized populations increasingly pushed farther away from opportunities and essential infrastructure. Knowing how best to position and implement smart city technology in order to most effectively address issues of inclusivity and equity is, in my view, a crucial task for the planning profession in the years to come. I believe it is important to critically assess the degree to which policy agendas responding to the advent of the smart city reflect potential impacts on citizens, and help shape these outcomes to ensure smart technology does not become an end in itself but rather a tool for building a healthier, more equitable, and more vibrant civic realm.</p>
